7C7CAEED,On rank correlation in information retrieval evaluation,"Some methods for rank correlation in evaluation are examined and their relative advantages and disadvantages are discussed. In particular, it is suggested that different test statistics should be used for providing additional information about the experiments other that the one provided by statistical significance testing. Kendall's τ is often used for testing-rank correlation, yet it is little appropriate if the objective of the test is different from what τ was designed for. In particular, attention should be paid to the null hypothesis. Other measures for rank correlation are described. If one test statistic suggests to reject a hypothesis, other test statistics should be used to support or to revise the decision. The paper then focuses on rank correlation between webpage lists ordered by PageRank for applying the general reflections on these test statistics. An interpretation of PageRank behaviour is provided on the basis of the discussion of the test statistics for rank correlation."," """"10.1109/ICPR48806.2021.9411963/,  """"10.1109/AICAI.2019.8701391/,  """"10.1007/978-3-030-11018-5_40/,  """"10.1109/CVPR.2017.125/,  """"10.1109/DSAA.2016.43/,  """"10.1108/AJIM-12-2014-0171/,  """"10.4018/978-1-4666-2854-0.ch010/,  """"10.1007/s10115-011-0391-7/,  """"10.1214/10-EJS577/,  """"10.1007/978-3-642-02469-6_43/,  """"10.1007/s13735-019-00178-7/,  """"10.1088/1742-5468/2015/07/P07002/",ACM SIGIR ForumVolume 41Issue 1June 2007  pp   18–33https://doi.org/10.1145/1273221.1273223,,Massimo Melucci
