   "url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1273221.1273223",
   "abstract": "Some methods for rank correlation in evaluation are examined and their relative advantages and disadvantages are discussed. In particular, it is suggested that different test statistics should be used for providing additional information about the experiments other that the one provided by statistical significance testing. Kendall's τ is often used for testing-rank correlation, yet it is little appropriate if the objective of the test is different from what τ was designed for. In particular, attention should be paid to the null hypothesis. Other measures for rank correlation are described. If one test statistic suggests to reject a hypothesis, other test statistics should be used to support or to revise the decision. The paper then focuses on rank correlation between webpage lists ordered by PageRank for applying the general reflections on these test statistics. An interpretation of PageRank behaviour is provided on the basis of the discussion of the test statistics for rank correlation."

   "abstract": " The thesis investigates how persons in an enterprise organisation can be ranked in response to a query, so that those persons with relevant expertise to the query topic are ranked first. The expertise areas of the persons are represented by documentary evidence of expertise, known as candidate profiles. The statement of this research work is that the expert search task in an enterprise setting can be successfully and effectively modelled using a voting paradigm. In the so-called Voting Model, when a document is retrieved for a query, this document represents a vote for every expert associated with the document to have relevant expertise to the query topic. This voting paradigm is manifested by the proposition of various voting techniques that aggregate the votes from documents to candidate experts. Moreover, the research work demonstrates that these voting techniques can be modelled in terms of a Bayesian belief network, providing probabilistic semantics for the proposed voting paradigm.,  The proposed voting techniques are thoroughly evaluated on three standard expert search test collections, deriving conclusions concerning each component of the Voting Model, namely the method used to identify the documents that represent each candidate's expertise areas, the weighting models that are used to rank the documents, and the voting techniques which are used to convert the ranking of documents into the ranking of experts. Effective settings are identified and insights about the behaviour of each voting technique are derived. Moreover, the practical aspects of deploying an expert search engine such as its efficiency and how it should be trained are also discussed.,  This thesis includes an investigation of the relationship between the quality of the underlying ranking of documents and the resulting effectiveness of the voting techniques. The thesis shows that various effective document retrieval approaches have a positive impact on the performance of the voting techniques. Interestingly, it also shows that a `perfect' ranking of documents does not necessarily translate into an equally perfect ranking of candidates. Insights are provided into the reasons for this, which relate to the complexity of evaluating tasks based on ranking aggregates of documents.,  Furthermore, it is shown how query expansion can be adapted and integrated into the expert search process, such that the query expansion successfully acts on a pseudo-relevant set containing only a list of names of persons. Five ways of performing query expansion in the expert search task are proposed, which vary in the extent to which they tackle expert search-specific problems, in particular, the occurrence of topic drift within the expertise evidence for each candidate.,  Not all documentary evidence of expertise for a given person are equally useful, nor may there be sufficient expertise evidence for a relevant person within an enterprise. This thesis investigates various approaches to identify the high quality evidence for each person, and shows how the World Wide Web can be mined as a resource to find additional expertise evidence.,  This thesis also demonstrates how the proposed model can be applied to other people search tasks such as ranking blog(ger)s in the blogosphere setting, and suggesting reviewers for the submitted papers to an academic conference.,  The central contributions of this thesis are the introduction of the Voting Model, and the definition of a number of voting techniques within the model. The thesis draws insights from an extremely large and exhaustive set of experiments, involving many experimental parameters, and using different test collections for several people search tasks. This illustrates the effectiveness and the generality of the Voting Model at tackling various people search tasks and, indeed, the retrieval of aggregates of documents in general."

   "abstract": "\nDocument clustering is useful in many information retrieval tasks: document browsing, organization and viewing of retrieval results, generation of Yahoo-like hierarchies of documents, etc. The general goal of clustering is to group data elements such that the intra-group similarities are high and the inter-group similarities are low. We present a clustering algorithm called CBC (Clustering By Committee) that is shown to produce higher quality clusters in document clustering tasks as compared to several well known clustering algorithms. It initially discovers a set of tight clusters (high intra-group similarity), called committees, that are well scattered in the similarity space (low inter-group similarity). The union of the committees is but a subset of all elements. The algorithm proceeds by assigning elements to their most similar committee. Evaluating cluster quality has always been a difficult task. We present a new evaluation methodology that is based on the editing distance between output clusters and manually constructed classes (the answer key). This evaluation measure is more intuitive and easier to interpret than previous evaluation measures.\n"

   "abstract": "\nA series of Japanese full-text retrieval experiments were conducted using an inference network document retrieval model. The retrieval performance of two major indexing methods, character-based and word-based, were evaluated. Using structured queries, the character-based indexing performed retrieval as well as, or slightly better, than the word-based system. This result has practical significance since the character-based indexing speed is considerably faster than the traditional word-based indexing. All the queries in this experiment were automatically formulated from natural language input.\n"

   "abstract": "\nRanking is a very important topic in information retrieval. While algorithms for learning ranking models have been intensively studied, this is not the case for feature selection, despite of its importance. The reality is that many feature selection methods used in classification are directly applied to ranking. We argue that because of the striking differences between ranking and classification, it is better to develop different feature selection methods for ranking. To this end, we propose a new feature selection method in this paper. Specifically, for each feature we use its value to rank the training instances, and define the ranking accuracy in terms of a performance measure or a loss function as the importance of the feature. We also define the correlation between the ranking results of two features as the similarity between them. Based on the definitions, we formulate the feature selection issue as an optimization problem, for which it is to find the features with maximum total importance scores and minimum total similarity scores. We also demonstrate how to solve the optimization problem in an efficient way. We have tested the effectiveness of our feature selection method on two information retrieval datasets and with two ranking models. Experimental results show that our method can outperform traditional feature selection methods for the ranking task.\n"

   "abstract": "\nContent-targeted advertising, the task of automatically associating ads to a Web page, constitutes a key Web monetization strategy nowadays. Further, it introduces new challenging technical problems and raises interesting questions. For instance, how to design ranking functions able to satisfy conflicting goals such as selecting advertisements (ads) that are relevant to the users and suitable and profitable to the publishers and advertisers? In this paper we propose a new framework for associating ads with web pages based on Genetic Programming (GP). Our GP method aims at learning functions that select the most appropriate ads, given the contents of a Web page. These ranking functions are designed to optimize overall precision and minimize the number of misplacements. By using a real ad collection and web pages from a newspaper, we obtained a gain over a state-of-the-art baseline method of 61.7% in average precision. Further, by evolving individuals to provide good ranking estimations, GP was able to discover ranking functions that are very effective in placing ads in web pages while avoiding irrelevant ones.\n"

   "url": "https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/1571941.1572034",
   "abstract": "\nSocial tagging is becoming increasingly popular in many Web 2.0 applications where users can annotate resources (e.g. Web pages) with arbitrary keywords (i.e. tags). A tag recommendation module can assist users in tagging process by suggesting relevant tags to them. It can also be directly used to expand the set of tags annotating a resource. The benefits are twofold: improving user experience and enriching the index of resources. However, the former one is not emphasized in previous studies, though a lot of work has reported that different users may describe the same concept in different ways. We address the problem of personalized tag recommendation for text documents. In particular, we model personalized tag recommendation as a \"query and ranking\" problem and propose a novel graph-based ranking algorithm for interrelated multi-type objects. When a user issues a tagging request, both the document and the user are treated as a part of the query. Tags are then ranked by our graph-based ranking algorithm which takes into consideration both relevance to the document and preference of the user. Finally, the top ranked tags are presented to the user as suggestions. Experiments on a large-scale tagging data set collected from Del.icio.us have demonstrated that our proposed algorithm significantly outperforms algorithms which fail to consider the diversity of different users' interests.\n"
